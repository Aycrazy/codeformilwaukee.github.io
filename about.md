## About Code for Milwaukee

We are a group of civic-minded technologists, and tech-interested civically engaged residents.  As the Milwaukee business, philanthropic, and government sectors invest in partnerships to develop tech talent within the county and city, we, the Code for Milwaukee team, believe it is important to establish a grass-roots effort to link existing and developing talent with efforts to modernize government as well as to improve the provision of public goods and social services.
